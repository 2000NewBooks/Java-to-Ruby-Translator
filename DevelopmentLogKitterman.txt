The first day of working on our project. Today me and Carson started writing a class that can recognize Ruby code. If the inputted code is not legit ruby code, it screams at you and throws some exceptions. I am also starting to relearn ruby. The toughest part about it is that in Ruby, for loops are nowhere similar to those in Java. The while loops are also pretty crazy. We'll need to implement the whole loop syntax in an "if" statement, and if it is ever so slightly wrong, we'll throw an exception and reprompt the user. There are also a lot more loops and statements in Ruby, so that's more that can go wrong in our program. We'll have to save their whole input as a string then save several ints and strings and use .split() method then check each element to see if it matches the syntax we've written.
