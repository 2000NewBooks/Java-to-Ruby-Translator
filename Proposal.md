# Proposal: Ruby to Java Converter
## A Program that can translate Ruby scripts to java programs
Andrew Kitterman and
Carson Sloan

## Needs and Opportunities
After doing some research, we noticed that there are no good, easy-to-use, free converters between different programming languages.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Our program will be ideal for people who need an easy and fast way to turn their Ruby script into a fully working java program.

## Product
The final product will be a fully functional program that is able to turn a working Ruby script into a compileable, functioning java
program.

## Timeline
| Date          |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Class that recognizes statements and loops in Ruby |
| April 1       | Class that can recognize the entirety of Ruby |
| April 29      | Class that converts Ruby to java |

## Reality Check
We will most likely not need to purchase any products for the creation of this project.

## Conclusion
Previously, anyone looking for a nice, free converter between different programming languages would be out of luck. However, after the completion of our program, they will be luckier than ever before, with a user-friendly, quick and functional Ruby to java Converter!
