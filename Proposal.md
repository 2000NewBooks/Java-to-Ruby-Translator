# Proposal: Java to Ruby Converter
## A Program that can transpose Java programs to Ruby scripts
Andrew Kitterman and
Carson Sloan

## Needs and Opportunities
After doing some research, we noticed that there were no good, easy-to-use, free converters between different programming languages.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Our program will be ideal for people who need an easy and fast way to turn their java program into a fully working Ruby script.

## Product
The final product will be a fully functional program that is able to turn compiled Java code into a working Ruby script.

## Timeline
| Date          |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Class that recognizes statements and loops in Ruby |
| April 1       | Class that can recognize the entirety of Ruby |
| April 29      | Class that converts Java to Ruby |

## Reality Check
We will most likely not need to purchase any products for the creation of this project.

## Conclusion
Previously, anyone looking for a nice, free converter between different programming languages would be out of luck. However, after the completion of our program, they will be luckier than ever before, with a user-friendly, quick and functional Java to Ruby Converter!
