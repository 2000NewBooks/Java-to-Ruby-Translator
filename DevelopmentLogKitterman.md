The first day of working on our project. Today me and Carson started writing a class that can recognize Ruby code. If the inputted code is not legit ruby code, it screams at you and throws some exceptions. I am also starting to relearn ruby. The toughest part about it is that in Ruby, for loops are nowhere similar to those in Java. The while loops are also pretty crazy. We'll need to implement the whole loop syntax in an "if" statement, and if it is ever so slightly wrong, we'll throw an exception and reprompt the user. There are also a lot more loops and statements in Ruby, so that's more that can go wrong in our program. We'll have to save their whole input as a string then save several ints and strings and use .split() method then check each element to see if it matches the syntax we've written.

 -Today the battle continues. Ruby is a stupid piece of garbage because half of it doesn't make any sense. Even Git seems to be better. At least in Java you don't have to put a dollar sign before every single variable. Alas, I have also started writing the first method of our project. It recognizes loops in ruby and tells the user what they should write in their Java compiler that they have downloaded maybe. It's pretty functional, but you have to be 100 percent correct in your code writing. If you deviate from the standard at all, the code will print "Nope." and then end itself. I think this really encourages people to get better at the language they are writing in(Ruby). I will continue writing the program until it is more user friendly and accepts deviations from the norm. It will be hard though, as I'll have to write if() 98504783246823974 times. It will probably be worth it though because this is a really good program and will help a lot of people in their struggles.

 -Trying to program a project that recognizes the entirety of Ruby was definetely a bad idea. We can't do it at our specified deadline so we changed it. The rest of the class I was writing our new deliverable. It will only recognize the loops and statements in Ruby. It's going to be much easier. We also changed the second deliverable to our original first deliverable that recognizes all of Ruby. So far the program is going well. It can recognize while loops, for loops, and until loops. Implementing Ruby into Java was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Basically I need to write code that accepts basic syntax for Ruby and checks it against things that are already written. It can also recognize break statements, retry statements and redo statements. It's working pretty well so far, we just need to implement the rest of the loops and statements.

 -Today we have finished and turned in our first deliverable. It is working pretty well, the only broken thing is the until loop tester. We have no idea how to make our translate() method read more than one line. This is okay though, the rest is good. The other checks read the first line to see if it is the correct loop. Then it outputs what you should write in java, assuming it was in Ruby when you typed it. The other method is a filewriter does stuff. You input the name of your file, the code checks to see if you have that file on your PC, converts it to java using the translate() method(well, only the loops as of now), and prints out a new file that has been converted. We're aiming to be able to read all of your file, then with the next deliverable be able to convert all that to java. This is not going to be that hard, just a bunch of switches and if-else if-else statements. Maybe a for loop to go through your entire file in one fell swoop.

 -Today working on the project went well. We are starting to write the implementation for recognition of the entire ruby language. We are going to have to use for loops for whenever someone wants to do a statement more than once. We'll have them input a number of times they want to do something, then iterate the statement that many times. Also the filereader is good. It accepts a file, reads it, and tries to convert it to java. Ruby is pretty compact, so we're going to give them back a file that is a lot larger. The scope of variables in ruby is also pretty hard to understand. Basically everything is global unless you put it in some sort of block? Whatever, at least you don't need a semicolon at the end of every line :). The loop converter is fully functional now, because I took the time over the weekend to fix it.

 -Working was good, we made lots of progress. At least in understanding how Ruby works and the translations we are going to need to make. We are also going to run a single filewriter. It reads the file one line at a time, then prints out the appropriate java code to a different file. This is going to run pretty well. Then we started to write code to translate all the weird stuff like.
 -
 -twice.do{//code}
 -
 -puts#//word{name}
 -
 -for($i...115) & for($i .. 115)
 -
 -twice.do will be replaced with a for loop that iterates twice, and puts will be replaced with System.out.println
 -The for loops will be replaced with for loops that run num times for three dots, and num-1 dots for two dots.
 -
 -We will also need to check out the different declarations of variables in ruby. That's it for now.

 -We've implemented all the things that I said would be hard last week. Turns out that we just needed to call one of our methods that prints out a for loop. All in all, I'd say today was pretty successful. puts was replaced with system.out.println, and the for loops were just incremented by one if they have three dots instead of two. Java and Ruby are languages with the same focus, but very dissimilar code. That makes a lot of the conversions innacurate, like if someone wants to do a java loop, it's a slightly different function in ruby and it will change a whole lot in the file that we print out. I think the most successful part of our project so far was writing a translator class that reads an uploaded file one line at a time, and then translates the code line by line. I'm pretty impressed with our progress so far

 -Today we finished our deliverable. Great. It does all the basic math operations, a lot of the common ruby stuff, and variable assignment in Ruby. That's pretty good, as we realized that we couldn't make it recognize the whole language. Well, maybe, but translating all that would take many years. Which means that writing the recognition code would take many days. Probably more than a month. But now you just upload your file, we translate it. Our code is pretty good. Math operations will be hard to translate, since they are the same in java and ruby, but if we don't recognize the code, it will throw an invalid argument exception and return, and that wouldn't look very good. We are planning to write more recognition and translations by later this month. We'll get it done.

 -Today we tried to add the exceptions in Ruby, and they are pretty hard to encode. We have to check that they made a class, and they aren't making a new class when they try to make an error. That's so weird. Why? Some of the names of exceptions are just weird. WidgetError. FrobError. Like, why? Then we have to find the index of the pointy arrow thing, >, check that class was behind it, then 
 -check the exception. Also, they probably won't understand what throwing something is. We'll need to automatically import the standard java libraries. Util, awt, image, io, security, all the libraries. This should only be a couple lines of code at the start of the translator. So it's going pretty good. Ruby is magic, but their conventions are so much more different than the java ones, it's amazing that you can even translate the two.

 -We worked some on our program. But today we mostly worked on our ampersands. We also drew some dank memes on the board, such as T-Mail, Business Flying Disks, Musical notes as ampersands, and why libraries aren't allowed. This went pretty well, just like our program. We've implemented lots of things, such as hashes, and some other things I will look up in our code. This is going well, as we can just import one java library to do all of hash tables. Those are pretty hard. Yeah, java libraries are really unfair and dumb because you can just do the same things you already do in ruby, like arrays.sort(). Ruby actually reads like English, while java is just this dumb semicolon garbage after you want to write a single line. Well, overall this went pretty well. Maybe we can do Java.image.*; for Ruby images.

 -4/22/16
 -So we're starting to translate all of the more advanced stuff in Ruby to java. So far, so good. HashTables, SetTables and HashMaps will be really tricky, so we saving them for last. What else would we do, the hard stuff first? Yeah, so that's going well. We got a lot of recognition coded in, althought now we have an error in creating a fileWriter, so I put it in a try-catch but now it's losing scope no matter where I put it, and it will just error otherwise. That's pretty bad, as we could just not be able to fix it and keep it that way forever. We'll fix it, don't worry. Yeah, we got variable declaration completely done. We also have user input done, that was pretty easy. .chomp = System.out.println(); so that was a pretty simple translation. going good, our third deliverable is going to be done soon.

 -I don't even know what we did today. Basically we added like so many translations that don't translate, but recognize. Our third deliverable is all about recognition. Things we have left: HashMaps, HashTables, SetTables, all that really hard garbage that will take multiple lines to check and translate. Not that bad, but like more difficult than anything we've done yet, besides the actual project. We have all the basic functions down, such as variable assignment, loops, operators, Array things, and stuff like that. Pretty simple, but still. That's all we have left. Then today we looked up how these things are implemented and tried our best to think of how we would translate this. Best idea: in the if statement, we'll have another if statement that checks the next line. Pretty weird.

 -Today I finished all of the basic functionality of our translator, which does the basic stuff in ruby, like variable declaration, hashes, class declaration, math and stuff, all that. The only thing I don't understand is scope. Like variable scope, class scope, and noscoping in Ruby. I also javadoc'd everything in our project, and commented about things in our code. It now translates like half of what it recognizes. That's good, because it would take years, maybe even days to translate all of Ruby to Java. Libraries would be a great help, because I'm pretty sure Java has some things that just do some of this, but not all. So far, so good, and almost done. Actually I think it is done, we just need to make sure by testing it a couple times, with ruby files. I also got an odd exception where our code thought that the index of a thing we translated was -11.

 -Today I edited some of the comments I made, thinking that it was bad practice to assume our user was dumb, but then Schreiber said na, you can do that, so I kept the comments absolutely necessary to understanding what our code does. I feel kind of dumb for doing that when I could just have kept them all and said that it was to teach the users how our program operates. I asked Ms. Ekhoff for help on my Computer Science project, and Mr Schreiber said to her even if you press random buttons, it will still be better than his code which is wrong because I'm the one taking the class. He also told me to stop writing inefficient code and that I should git gud. Well, I won't, and I'll keep writing recursive things in for loops, because StackOverflow is such a great exception and teaches me so much about coding and all that.

 This be the realist programmer in the game, it's Kitterman. We worked on our powerpoint presentation, the ruby script for our live demo, and we discussed what each of us would talk about. So we decided, that Carson would do the second slide and I would do the first, going by every other one. Yeah, not that bad. I think we're going to do really well If I don't mess up, because carson never messes up. We'll be doing a live demo, because otherwise no one will believe that it worked if I recorded it, because jump-cuts are a thing. It won't be that bad, I just need to read off of a paper, and so does Carson, and you'll be like omg Kitterman 2pro4me. It'll be good.
