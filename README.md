#Ruby-to-Java Translator
##A program that can take a working Ruby script, and translate it into a Java program with the same functionality

To Use:
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to input the name of the Ruby file you would like translated, then the name of the file
that will be output.
Put in both file names, and it will create a new file with your translated java code in a few moments
If the program finds a keyword it doen't understand, it will throw some exceptions at you, and skip the line
