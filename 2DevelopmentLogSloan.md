    Today we began writing a class that can determine if the code inputted by the user is actually Ruby, so that the translator can work.\n If it isn't, the program will throw some exceptions at them. We also began relearning Ruby, so that we can know what different\n Ruby code snippets can be replaced by Java code, and retain the same functionality that the original Ruby program had. This will most\n likely take quite a bit of time and testing, as we have to think of all possible Ruby commands that a user might have used in their\n program.\n

    Today I worked more on relearning Ruby, and realized how different of a programming language it is from java. I also now realize how\n hard it will be to do the translator, as we have to be able to handle anything the user puts in, whether its actually code or not.\n We are getting fairly close to finishng our class that can recognize actual Ruby code. After this is complete, we will begin\n making the main translator class that will replace the Ruby commands with java code that can do the same thing.\n
